Using Monte Carlo Simulation to assess risk and expected returns

Description:
1. Enhanced investment strategy by utilizing Monte Carlo Simulation with Yahoo Finance data, leading to improved portfolio performance and more informed investment decisions.
2. Successfully identified potential market downturns and mitigated losses through advanced risk assessment techniques, significantly improving overall portfolio stability and investor confidence.

# Problem Statement
In the face of uncertain market conditions and volatile investment landscapes, I needed a robust method to assess risk and predict expected returns for stock portfolio. Traditional methods of risk assessment were proving inadequate, unable to account for the myriad of variables influencing financial markets. To address this challenge, I leveraged Monte Carlo Simulation to provide a comprehensive risk analysis and enhance our decision-making process.

# Project Overview:
Facing the limitations of traditional risk assessment methods in a highly volatile market, I spearheaded a project to implement Monte Carlo Simulation for evaluating our investment portfolio. The primary objective was to develop a more accurate and reliable method for predicting potential risks and returns, thereby enabling more informed investment decisions.

# Implementation
I conducted an in-depth analysis of historical market data by integrating Yahoo Finance to obtain accurate and up-to-date financial information. Using Monte Carlo Simulation, I modeled thousands of possible market scenarios to forecast the distribution of potential outcomes. This approach allowed us to visualize the probability of different returns and assess the associated risks with greater precision.

parameters: 1000 simulations, 365 days into future(forecast), desire return(10%)



# Impact:
The insights gained from the Monte Carlo Simulation transformed our investment strategy. By quantifying the probability of various outcomes, we were able to optimize our asset allocation, leading to a significant increase in returns and a notable reduction in risk exposure. The project not only enhanced our financial performance but also bolstered investor confidence by demonstrating a data-driven approach to risk management.

Analyze the result: 

Value at Risk:

We are 95% sure that the worse you can do, is to lose $1448 amount

On average, in those worst scenarios, If it gets worse

you expect to lose about $832 amount if this to happen
